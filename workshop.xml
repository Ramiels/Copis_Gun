Replaces your starter wand with the Glock 17, a powerful handgun. You are equipped with an unlimited supply of 17 bullet magazines filled with silver 9mm shots, which automatically reload upon depletion.
Armed and ready, seek revenge on those magic, tech, and nature bastards who wronged you. The silver shots will hurt anything they touch, assuming it isn't invulnerable.

[u][b][i]Warnings[/i][/b][/u]
You are HEAVILY advised to disable the [u]Low Resolution Rendering[/u] setting,
as it looks absolutely abhorrent and ruins the appearance of the gun as seen below
